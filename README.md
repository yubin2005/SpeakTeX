## 🎙️ SpeakTeX: From Voice to LaTeX

## 🚀 Project Overview
SpeakTeX is a web application that converts spoken mathematical expressions into LaTeX code. Simply speak into your microphone, and watch as your mathematical expressions are instantly rendered in beautiful LaTeX.

## 🎯 Our Project Goal: Audio → LaTeX
- A web application: Users speak mathematical expressions into a microphone. The application converts the speech to LaTeX code in real time and renders the mathematical expression.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User speaks mathematical expression into microphone
2. Audio sent to backend API
3. Gemini API processes audio/text and converts to LaTeX
4. Frontend renders LaTeX using MathJax
5. User can copy LaTeX code or save to history
