## üéôÔ∏è SpeakTeX: From Voice to LaTeX


## üöÄ Project Overview
- SpeakTeX is a web application that transforms spoken mathematical expressions into LaTeX code and renders them in real time.  Hands-free, just by speaking naturally!

## üéØ Our Project Goal: Audio -> LaTeX
- A web application: Users speak mathematical expressions into a microphone. The application converts the speech to LaTeX code in real time and renders the mathematical expression.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. User speaks mathematical expression into microphone
2. Audio uploaded to AWS S3 for storage
3. AWS Lambda processes audio and invokes Gemini API
4. Gemini API converts speech to LaTeX code
5. Frontend renders LaTeX using MathJax in real-time
6. User can copy LaTeX code or save to history
